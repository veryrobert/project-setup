# Guard::Compass
#
# You don't need to configure watchers for guard 'compass' declaration as they generated
# from your Compass configuration file. You might need to define the Compass working directory
# and point to the configuration file depending of your project structure.
#
# Available options:
#
# * :workging_directory => Define the Compass working directory, relative to the Guardfile directory
# * :configuration_file => Path to the Compass configuration file, relative to :project_path
#
# Like usual, the Compass configuration path are relative to the :project_path

# guard 'compass', :project_path => 'not_current_dir', :configuration_file => 'path/to/my/compass_config.rb'
guard :compass

# This will concatenate the javascript files specified in :files to public/js/all.js
# guard :concat, type: "js", files: %w(), input_dir: "public/js", output: "public/js/all"

# guard :concat, type: "css", files: %w(), input_dir: "public/css", output: "public/css/all"

guard 'livereload' do
  watch(%r{.+\.(erb|haml|slim)$})
end

# guard 'sass', :input => 'sass', :output => 'css'
